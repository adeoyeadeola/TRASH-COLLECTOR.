# ðŸ¤– Trash Collector Bot  

A **Trash Collector Robot** built with Arduino that can move autonomously, detect trash bins/objects, and collect or push trash into a container.  
This project combines **robotics, sensors, and automation** to promote cleanliness in homes, schools, and public spaces.  

- Overview  
The Trash Collector Bot uses:  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** to detect obstacles or trash in its path.  
- **DC motors with motor driver** for movement.  
- The scool  pick or push trash.  
- **Arduino Uno  controls the system.  

The bot moves forward, avoids obstacles, and can push trash toward a container or pick it up if fitted with a scoop.

- Arduino Uno 
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Motor Driver (L298)
- DC Motors with wheels (2 wheel chassis)  
- Servo Motor (for gripper or pushing arm)  
- Battery Pack (Li-ion / 9V / 12V)
